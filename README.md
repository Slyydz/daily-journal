# daily-journal

daily-journal is a web app that allows the user to post a journal entry using a collection of input boxes and will display previous entries(along with the new entries)on the page.
The user is also able to filter the displayed entries by the mood associated with them.

## Usage

For the application to function the user will need to go into the git terminal and type "serve" in the repository to run a local server for the page. Then the user will need to open another terminal window and jump into the api/ folder of the repository and use "json-server -p 8088 -w daily-journal.json".
